# CVE-2023-49438

## Proof of Concept

![flask-security-too-open-redirect](https://github.com/brandon-t-elliott/CVE-2023-49438/assets/126433368/e0f0383b-bc74-43fb-a5e0-de5901a447fd)

## Description

An open redirect vulnerability in the python package [Flask-Security-Too](https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/) <=version 5.3.2 allows attackers to redirect unsuspecting users to malicious sites via a crafted URL by abusing the ?next parameter on the /login and /register routes.

## Background

Flask-Security-Too contains logic to validate that the URL specified within the next parameter is either relative or has the same network location as the requesting URL. This is in place in an attempt to prevent open redirections.

The Flask-Security-Too python package was previously found to be vulnerable to a bypass of the validation logic in place, and version 4.1.0 patched the previously known examples such as `https://example/login?next=\\\github.com`

However, a workaround has been discovered due to how web browsers normalize slashes in URLs, which makes the package vulnerable as of version <=5.3.2.

## Examples

`https://example/login?next=/\github.com`

`https://example/login?next=\/github.com`
